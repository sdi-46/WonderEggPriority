# WonderEggPriority
An Intermediate-level Japanese-English vocabulary Anki flashcard deck for the anime series Wonder Egg Priority.

Use this Anki deck to familiarize yourself with the vocabulary used in the Wonder Egg Priority series, to make your watching experience more fluid and interesting!

I created this deck while watching through Wonder Egg Priority for the first time. Because this deck was created for personal use, I did not include words/phrases that are already easy for me to recall--therefore, it is best used by Intermediate-level Japanese students (or somewhere around N4-N3 of the JLPT). There is no romaji, and in most cases, the dictionary form of a verb is used in the deck, regardless of its use in context in the anime.

All definitions are from https://jisho.org.
You can download the Anki desktop application at https://apps.ankiweb.net.
You can watch the Wonder Egg Priority series on Funimation at https://www.funimation.com/shows/wonder-egg-priority/?qid=. Watch without subtitles for the best quality learning experience. ;)

If you have Anki already installed on your desktop, you should be able to open this deck as an Anki package directly from your Downloads. You can also use the CSV and/or Numbers files to import the cards into an existing deck.

Happy learning!
